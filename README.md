# Jekyll with Custom Bulma (Sandbox)

A sandbox to play around in and customize Jekyll with Bulma CSS. Might be used for your software project documentation that your want to push to Github-Pages based documentation.

## Usage

There are two ways to use this template: check that it works locally with a local Jekyll installation or push it to Github directly :) 
If you do decide to publish to Github-Pages you need to enable it in your Github Repository Settings and for source pick `master branch /docs folder`.

### Local 

1. [Install Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) version 2.4.0 or above (check with `ruby -v`). I had a lot of fun with this one because macOS comes with an old Ruby version. [Rubyenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#installation) did wonders for me:
    * `brew install rbenv`  
    * `rbenv init`  
    * Close terminal  
    * `which ruby` should now point to _~/.rbenv/shims/ruby_  
    * `rbenv install -v 2.6.3`
    * `rbenv local 2.6.3`
    * `ruby -v` should now be 2.6.3 for this directory  
2. Go into the docs directory  
  `cd docs`
3. Build the site and make it available on a local server:  
  `bundle exec jekyll serve`
4. Now browse to http://localhost:4000

### Github

Github uses Jekyll to render static site content for Github-Pages. Content in a top-level _docs folder_ or in a _branch gh-pages_ is automatically rendered.

Github does not support all Jekyll plugins however and only supports those it has whitelisted. If you want asciidoc rendering, you need to put it some effort because that plugin is not whitelisted (21. 8. 2019). Because Github does not support it, you need to **set up your own Jekyll** in your build pipeline and render the content yourself.


## About Jekyll

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) is a static site renderer written in Ruby and most notably it is directly supported by Github. 

### Favicon

The Favicon was generated with a [Favicon Generator/](https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/).

### Directory Structure

Jekyll has a convention-based [directory structure](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/) which can be configured by changing their default values in the `_config.yml`. If you see an `_` it's a safe bet that it's a file or folder which will be handled in a special way by Jekyll. **Every other directory will be copied verbatim to the generated site.**   

* `_config.yml` stores the [Jekyll configuration](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/).
* `_includes` stores page partials like `header.html` that can be included by the `_layouts`.
* `_layouts` are the templates that wrap posts. So if you write a new `.md` file and want to change how it's presented by Jekyll this is the place to look at.
* `_posts` contains the dynamic content that you want to render as static html pages. The naming convention of these files is important, and must follow the format: `YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUPLANGUAGE`.
* `_data` like `.yml`, `.yaml`, `.json`, `.csv` or `.tsv` can be placed here and referenced using `site.data.members`.
* `_sass` is for sass partials that can be imported into your `main.scss` which will then be processed into a single stylesheet `main.css` that defines the styles to be used by your site. 
* `_site` is where your statically generated site will be placed.

Files that contain a [Front Matter Section](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) will be copied verbatim but also be processed by Jekyll as a special file. The front matter must be the first thing in the file and must take the form of valid YAML set between triple-dashed lines. One example for this is the `assets/css/main.scss file` which is transformed from `.scss` to `.css`.

### SASS

Jekyll supports the [Sass (syntactically awesome style sheets)](https://sass-lang.com/) preprocessor. 

Sass lets you [use features that don't exist in CSS](https://sass-lang.com/guide) yet like variables, nesting, mixins, inheritance, import&embed and standard math operators like "+, -, /, %". According to the State of CSS the [other popular preprocessors](https://2019.stateofcss.com/technologies/pre-post-processors/) are [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/), [less](http://lesscss.org/) and [stylus](http://stylus-lang.com/).

> Sass supports [two different syntaxes](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax). Each one can import the other, so it's up to you and your team which one to choose.

The most popular syntax is the "SCSS" syntax which uses the file extension `.scss`. It's mostly a **superset of CSS**, so essentially all valid CSS is valid SCSS as well. 

The second syntax, with the file extension `.sass`, was was Sassâ€™s original syntax and still goes by the name "Sass". 

> It [supports all the same features](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax) as "SCSS", but it uses indentation instead of curly braces and semicolons to describe the format of the document.

### Relative_Urls

You might have noticed all these `{{url | relative_url}}`. They are required in my case because I have a custom domain. Might not be needed in your case.
